<!-- 
    JS Promise - 2
easy
Problem Statement
Complete the function checkCanIVote

Takes 2 arguments

1st argument time, which is the number of milliseconds after the function will resolve or reject

Second argument is the age upon (also a number) which you will use to return the string based on logic mentioned below

The function returns a promise, which will have 2 functions as arguments resolve and reject like any other promise.

The resolve function should be called with the argument "You can vote" after x milliseconds if age is greater than or equal to 18

The reject function should be called with the argument with "You can not vote" after x milliseconds if age less than 18




Note:- You only have to implement the function, in the example it
shows how your implemented question will be ran.
Input
Function will take two arguments

1) 1st argument will be a number which tells after how much milliseconds promise will be resolved or rejected.
2) 2nd argument will be a number (age)
Output
Function returns a promise which resolves to "You can vote" or rejects to "You can not vote".
If age >= 18 resolves to "You can vote" else rejects to "You can not vote".
Example
checkCanIVote(200, 70).then(data=>{
console.log(data) // prints 'You can vote'
}).catch((err)=>{
console.log(err) // does not do anything
})
checkCanIVote(200, 16).then(data=>{
console.log(data) // does not do anything
}).catch((err)=>{
console.log(err) // prints 'You can not vote'
})
