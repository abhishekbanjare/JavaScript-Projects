<!-- 
    Dark Theme
Have you seen the different themes of the editors? There's a light theme, and there's a dark theme. We will be building today a toggle theme functionality where we will click a button to change the theme from dark to light.
The HTML and CSS are already provided to you.

The p element should have the text I am a Newton School student, ready to become an awesome full stack developer

The main div should have id="app" and class="day"

The buttonshould have id="swap" and class="button_day"

Write the swapTheme function to change the class of the div to night and the class of the button to button_night. Calling the swapTheme function again should change the class of the div back to day and the class of the button back to button_day

Cliking the button should call the swapTheme function.
