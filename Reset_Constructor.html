<!-- 
    Problem Statement
You are given two constructor functions - Animal and Reptile where Reptile inherits from Animal (check the boilerplate code).

Currently, if you check the constructor property of objects instantiated from Reptile constructor, it would be set as [[Function: Animal]].
You have to reset the constructor property for constructor function Reptile such that all objects instantiated from Reptile constructor have [[Function: Reptile]] as their constructor property.

Note - You don't need to output anything, just write code to reset the constructor property.
Input
A string name and a number age.
Output
The constructor property for an instance of Reptile.
Example
const name = "snake"
const age = 10

const reptile = new Reptile(name, age)
console.log(reptile.constructor) // prints [Function: Reptile] on console
